# Nervos-api page

This project is an interactive demo for most of API methods of nervos.js.

You can learn how to use these APIs with [Neuron](https://github.com/cryptape/neuron-android) or [NeuronWeb](https://github.com/cryptape/nervos.js/tree/master/packages/neuron-web).

## Install
Clone the repo and get into the folder.
```
git clone https://github.com/cryptape/dapp-demos.git
cd dapp-demos/nervos-api
```

Install dependecies via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) first.
```
yarn install
```

## Use
To view this page properly, you need to start a local server from this folder.  
Here we use `SimpleHTTPServer` based on [Python](https://www.python.org/).
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000
```

Then you can view it via `http://localhost:3000/`
